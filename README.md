### Nintendont for Melee tournaments
Use it for Melee. Idiot-proof your setups and put nervous top players at ease.

See the [README](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/master/README.md) for standard Nintendont. It's just like that except:
* Native Control is locked to 'on'.
* It has codesets built-in, turn them on from the settings menu!
  * [OSReport](https://twitter.com/UnclePunch_/status/1017607009104023552): show error information if melee crashes. Take a photo and include it with your bug report!
  * [UCF 0.73](http://www.20xx.me/ucf.html): allow all controllers to dashback and shield drop equally.

### Quick Installation:
1. Get the [loader.dol](loader/loader.dol?raw=true), rename it to boot.dol and put it in /apps/Nintendont/ along with the files [meta.xml](nintendont/meta.xml?raw=true) and [icon.png](nintendont/icon.png?raw=true).
2. Copy your GameCube games to the /games/ directory. Subdirectories are optional for 1-disc games in ISO/GCM and CISO format.
   * For 2-disc games, you should create a subdirectory /games/MYGAME/ (where MYGAME can be anything), then name disc 1 as "game.iso" and disc 2 as "disc2.iso".
   * For extracted FST, the FST must be located in a subdirectory, e.g. /games/FSTgame/sys/boot.bin .
3. Connect your storage device to your Wii or Wii U and start The Homebrew Channel.
4. Select Nintendont.
